## Description:
The journey to fitness can be challenging, especially when it comes to committing to a gym routine and sticking with it. One strategy to help stay on track is using a gym companion app. Gym Buddy is designed to keep you accountable and motivated in your fitness journey! With Gym Buddy, users can track their workouts whenever they log in at the gym. Each user can create an account to sign up for fitness classes, log sets and reps from both exercise machines and free weights, and even access instructional animations for gym equipment if they're unsure how to use it. Once the workout is complete, users can stop their workout timer and review their workout history. This feature allows them to monitor their progress over time and stay motivated to keep pushing toward their fitness goals.

## Fun Fact:
I worked on the front end of theis project, especially the JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. And while other teams presented their capstones as webpages, we presented ours as a mobile app :)
